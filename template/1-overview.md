# Overview

FeedMe is a comprehensive app aiming at nurturing healthy eating habits among its users. It provides an extensive database of recipes to choose from with an accent on healthy ones. The app promotes those recipes using a personalized feed with recommendations based on ratings and the user's personal preferences, as well as recommending recipes based on the user's ingredients to help them to choose his next meal and encourage them to cook with what he has at home.


The goal of this PRD is to present our idea of a minimal viable app that will succeed in achieving a significant number of monthly users to make our app attractive enough for supermarkets to collaborate with us for a range of other features and accompany us in our second phase of development.

The app will be free at first and aimed mainly at students and single people, who are the most prone to eat instant meals or junk food instead of cooking. We will also only be aiming at Switzerland in the first place, to build a solid market in the country before considering expanding it.

We have built our app during the semester as a closed system with very few possible extensions in mind to achieve a MVP, however we seek to supplement it with a few more extensions as our rollout milestones are meant, so we plan to rethink our architecture diagram and database models with extensibility in mind during our MVP development process.

We seek to operate our app on both Android and iOS markets, as we feel that only operating it on Android severely reduce our potential market share.

# History

The proof-of-concept built during the semester contains our most important features for our MVP. We have several scanning modules allowing users to input ingredients, namely with barcode, text recognition scanning, and with an ingredient recognition module integrated with our camera. We also implemented basic user interactions, such as rating recipes, following profiles, and adding comments to recipes.

As mentioned during the overview, our app is built with no extensibility in mind. 
To build our MVP, we can reuse most of the code for the logic and the screens but we will need to put some thought into our data model and navigations in our app.
Furthermore, we only have a small subset of recipes with most being of low quality, which is a pain point for us. We plan to remove all recipes and find better quality ones to provide the best service possible to our users.
We also want to improve our recommendation algorithms for more relevance to users.
Finally, we want to improve user interactions and the user-friendliness of our application to have a more polished and streamlined product that feels pleasant and easy to navigate.

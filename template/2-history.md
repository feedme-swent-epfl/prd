*Describe the V1 POC as planned by Sprint10.*

*What did you learn?*

*What is missing to bridge from PoC to MVP?*

- POC contains only barcode and text recognition
- Implemented basic user interactions 
- Basic UI for displays
-  goal of mvp : build an app geared towards students accross Switzerland first then any Swiss citizen that trust our application to help them choose their meal that are budget-wise and healthiness-wise interesting for them, and build an app "interesting enough" for big supermarket chains to establish commercial contact (especially low-budget supermarkets type LIDL / ALDI, which will help us scale our product in other markets they are present on)

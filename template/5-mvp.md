# The MVP

The FeedMe MVP seeks to implement what is believed to be the most minimal set of features necessary for our product to bring value to our users. We have a lot of feature ideas that we want to bring to the FeedMe community, but we all need to start somewhere, and we think that the following user flows are the most essential for our FeedMe app and what we will focus on during this MVP conception:

- rating and commenting another user's recipe;
- seeing personnalized recommendation of recipes in your feed;
- relevant recipe recommendations after inputting ingredients;
- qualitative recipes that are simple and good;
- searching efficiently recipes (using filters and tags).


## Personas and Scenarios

We have only one persona that we will call users. We want this term to be as broad as possible because we don't target a particular demographics with our app in the long run, rather, we do believe that at first it will be easier to penetrate the students market and make waves there, as they represent a reasonable chunk of business and word of mouth is prevalent amongst them. 

The strategy for our MVP will be to focus on the students specific filters for the search engine for example, such as the budget one, in order for us to increase our appeal to the student population. After successful completion of student population penetration, we seek to penetrate the world of working individuals and thus englobing every person able to cook in Switzerland.

## Features Outside the Scope

We have plans to extend our application with additional features that we feel may bring value to our customers but are not strictly necessary for our MVP, among these are :

- a map containing nearby supermarkets and information on where to buy produce / cooking supplies;
- support for handwritten text recognition;
- accessibility support;
- support for multiple languages (with priority for the three official Swiss languages).

# The Value Proposition

*Describe the value proposition and argue that it is:*

*1. Easy to communicate*

*2. Defensible*

*3. Relevant*

- customer would possibly be users and supermarkets
    - offer the users the ability to have personalized feeds and meal recommendations
    - allow supermarkets to promote their products by giving us their barcode database + we can promote them to the user for missing ingredients
- many students don't cook because they don't know what to cook --> allows to bridge that difficulty

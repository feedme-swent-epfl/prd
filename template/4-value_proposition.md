# The Value Proposition


FeedMe offers a simplified and straightforward to plan meals with information on their cost, nutritional values, and by recommending meals with ingredients you like and/or already have. 

By curating personalized meal recommendations, we encourage our users to get rid of the habit of eating instant meals, takeout, or junk food, and instead encourage them to pursue healthy eating habits.

We believe that the quality of our recipes and recommendations will incentivize users to return to our app, thus establishing it as a vital part of their routine. We also think that returning users having found value in our app will be more prone to contributing by adding recipes of their own and participating in its growth as a social community for like-minded people.

Eventually, supermarkets will also be our customers, with the goal to promote their brand and advertise their products. Our value proposition to the supermarkets is as follows :

- having a sponsored account to publish recipes of their own with their own products;
- including the price and nutritional value of the products they own in all recipes;
- including a map with stores of that brand close to the user's location to encourage him to buy at those.

This collaboration will also allow us to have up-to-date barcode information of their products, making our app more efficient and valuable to the users. The supermarkets will benefit from the additional advertisement provided and can act upon the customers of our app shopping there to build their loyalty towards the brand. 

The pricing model of the collaboration between the supermarkets and our service is still unsure, but some possibilities might be :

- an annual service fee for the right to have an account, with another commitment for an exclusivity contract;
- a commission based on the number of clicks on their profile, and the number of users visiting the supermarket (supplied with a discount code for example).

As our app grows, we will have to think about expanding the social community aspect of our app to incentivize people to return more to it, not only as a way of planning their meals but also as a way to learn more about food and eating in general. We plan to do that by adding the ability to write educational and promotional articles related to food.

# User Analytics and Acceptance

During our planned beta testing, we seek to collect as much data as possible from the users to identify potential bugs and implement minor UI improvements to improve the user experience as much as possible before the full release of our app.

The usage metrics, success criterias and the analysis plan will be relevant for both the beta testing and the full release of our app, while the A/B testing will be especially relevant during the beta test period to help us take informed decisions on the design specifications at hand. A few success criteria are dependant on the results of our A/B testing plans.

### Usage Metrics

- Percentage of active users over all users
- Frequency of app use, user retention
- Frequency of features use
- Average length of a session
- Frequency and patterns of bugs and crashes

### Success Criteria

- Reasonable user retention and frequency of app use, at least 50%
- Quick resolution of bugs and crashes
- Successful identification of high load time periods for our app
- Good feedback on our UI and user friendliness

### User Analytics  

- Number of downloads from app stores
- Source of users (how did the users learn about us ?) through survey, helps identifying the most relevant marketing tool
- Demographic tracking (who installs our app ?) via Google account
- Behavioral tracking via Google Analytics
- Stability monitoring via Firebase Crashlytics and Apple App Analytics

Once our app scales enough, we plan on using the premium plan of  \textcolor{blue}{\underline{\href{https://www.data.ai/en/product/free-premium/}{data.ai}}} to track all relevant data more efficiently. 

### A/B Testing Ideas
We plan to take advantage of the beta testing phase to release multiple iterations of the app with minor improvments to the UI to help each customer to enjoy our product. We have identified a few user flows, transitions, and screens we would like to experiment with :
    
- try different ways of navigating through the app $\\$ $\indent \indent \Rightarrow$ focusing on the user flows of creating a recipe, commenting a recipe, and inputting ingredients
- multiple layouts for the profile and recipe displays
- include an aesthetic idle page design for loading or elapsed time operations
- try both the Android and iOS apps and check if they have a similar feel UI-wise

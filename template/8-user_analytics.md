# User Analytics and Acceptance

*Goal: understand how users are using the app.*

*Which are the key metrics?*

*What is the success criteria?*

*What is the analysis plan (link to data collection)?*

*Include relevant A/B testing ideas.*

During our planned beta testing, we seek to collect as much data as possible from the users to identify potential bugs and implement minor UI improvements to improve the user experience as much as possible before the full release of our app. 

The usage metrics, success criterias and the analysis plan will be relevant for both the beta testing and the full release of our app, while the A/B testing will be especially relevant during the beta period to help us take informed decisions on the design specifications at hand.

### Usage Metrics

### Success Criteria
success :
    - high returning users
    - low crash
    - few bug fixes

### User Analytics

### A/B Testing Ideas
A/B testing :
    - experiment with the different user flows and see how user friendly they are
    - identify optimal formats for displaying data
    - loading / idle page designs
    - android vs ios, how different they are ?

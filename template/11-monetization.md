# Business Model

We plan to have an evolving business model that will be adapted each important threshold our app user base reaches. Our business model will have 3 important evolutions that will be discussed below :

### 1. Free

At first, we plan to release our app completely for free for the users to attract them and achieve high retention rated and increasing monthly active users. We will begin achieving some revenue through data monetization at first, as we don't wish to add advertisements in our app as it can feel very intrusive for the customers.

### 2. Partnerships

Parallely, as our app grows its user base, we plan on taking advantage of the high retention rate to negotiate partnerships and sponsorships with brands. The end goal would be to have an official and unique supermarket completely sponsoring us and contributing both financially and content-wise to our app. In the meantime, we plan to have multiple partnerships leveraging our platform to boost their sales. 

### 3. Freemium

We plan to add other features, which are not described in the scope of our MVP, that we will restrict to a few subsribed users. We will offer a 3 month free trial for every user already registered on our platform (to incentivize them to use the premium features as well as thanking them for supporting us since early on) while new users will only have a 1 month free trial. We plan to make it a monthly subscription with a discount for multiple months subscriptions (package of 6, 9, and 12 months). At this phase, we may decide to add advertisements in our free version of the application to gently push people towards our premium version. Also, depending on the rate of premium users, we may start focusing on the premium version more as the flagship product and slowly make the free features obsolete / restricted / not as efficient as the premium version.

### Expected costs 
We also have several expected costs to factor in, most of them being recurrent. We have to take into account the development resources and the deployment resources discussed above, which are split between recurring salaries and subscriptions and one-time hardware purchases. We also need to factor in a surplus of money for any impromptu failure or unexpected event we can only solve with money. Below is a table with deployment costs and subscriptions costs.
